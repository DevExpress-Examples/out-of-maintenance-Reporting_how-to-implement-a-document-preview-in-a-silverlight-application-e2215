# How to implement a Document Preview in a Silverlight application


<p>This example demonstrates how you can add XtraReport to a Silverlight application and show its Document Preview from where it can be printed and/or exported to a variety of popular formats (notably PDF, HTML, MHT, RTF, TXT, CSV, XLS, XLSX, and XPS).</p>
<p>A document exporting is performed via a reporting service deployed on the server-side.</p>
<p>This sample contains two projects:</p>
<p>- <em>SilverlightApplication1</em>, providing functionality for the client-side Document Preview;</p>
<p>- <em>SilverlightApplication1.Web</em>, with the report service hosted on the server to generate reports.</p>
<p>NOTE: For this example to work correctly, <em>SilverlightApplication1.Web</em> must be set as a "Start Up Project" and the <em>SilverlightApplication1TestPage.aspx</em> must be set as a "Start Page".</p>
